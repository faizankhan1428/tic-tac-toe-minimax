# 🎮 Game AI – Exercise 2: Tic Tac Toe (Minimax AI)

This notebook builds a Tic Tac Toe game with an AI player powered by the Minimax algorithm. The AI evaluates all possible moves to play optimally against a fixed human move list.

### 🔍 What’s Inside:
- Implemented Tic Tac Toe board logic
- Minimax algorithm with recursion
- Predefined moves (no user input)
- Prints game progress turn-by-turn

### 🎯 Learning Goal:
- Understand how game tree search works
- Learn to write and apply Minimax in Python
- Get hands-on experience with decision-making in turn-based games

### 🚀 Extensions:
- Add alpha-beta pruning
- Turn into a web game using Flask or PyGame
- Handle user input for actual play (off-Kaggle)
